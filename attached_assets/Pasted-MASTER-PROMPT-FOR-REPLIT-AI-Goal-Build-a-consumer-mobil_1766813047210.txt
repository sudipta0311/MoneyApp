MASTER PROMPT FOR REPLIT AI

Goal:
Build a consumer mobile app for India that explains financial transactions from SMS and Gmail in simple language, without giving any financial advice.

🔹 App Name (working)

“Explain My Money”

🔹 Core Purpose

The app reads user-permitted SMS and Gmail messages related to banking, UPI, and card transactions and explains what happened in plain English.

The app must:

NOT give investment advice

NOT suggest actions

ONLY explain past transactions

🔹 Supported Data Sources
1️⃣ SMS (Android only)

Read incoming SMS only after user permission

Detect messages related to:

UPI transactions

Debit card / credit card transactions

Bank debit / credit alerts

Detection keywords (example):

UPI, debited, credited, INR, Rs, txn, transaction, ref no, successful

2️⃣ Gmail (Optional, user-opt-in)

Use Gmail API with read-only permission OR manual email forwarding.

Only process emails from:

Banks

Credit card issuers

UPI apps

Payment confirmations (Amazon, utilities, etc.)

Search filters:

subject/body contains: debited, credited, payment, INR, Rs, UPI

🔹 What the App Should Extract

From each SMS or email:

Amount

Debit or Credit

Date / Time (if available)

Merchant / sender (if available)

Reference / transaction ID (if available)

Source (SMS or Gmail)

🔹 Explanation Logic (VERY IMPORTANT)

The app should convert raw messages into friendly explanations like:

Example output:

“💸 You paid ₹850 using UPI.
This payment was successful and confirmed by your bank.”

Rules:

Use simple, non-technical language

No advice words like:

“should”

“invest”

“avoid”

“recommend”

Only describe what already happened

🔹 AI Usage Rules

Use lightweight LLM prompting only to:

Rewrite extracted data into human-friendly text

No predictions

No analysis of spending behavior

No recommendations

🔹 UI Requirements (Simple MVP)
Screens:

Permission screen (SMS / Gmail opt-in)

Transaction list (latest first)

Transaction explanation screen

Privacy & disclaimer screen

🔹 Mandatory Disclaimer (must be shown)

Include this text exactly or very close:

“This app only explains transaction messages you receive.
It does not provide financial, investment, or legal advice.”

🔹 Privacy & Compliance Requirements

Clearly ask permission before:

Reading SMS

Accessing Gmail

Allow users to:

Disconnect Gmail

Disable SMS reading

Do NOT:

Sell data

Share data

Store full email bodies unnecessarily

🔹 Tech Stack Preference

Frontend: React Native / Expo

Backend: Node.js or Python

Storage: Local storage + lightweight DB

AI: Prompt-based explanation (no agents)

🔹 Explicit Constraints (DO NOT VIOLATE)

❌ No investment advice
❌ No portfolio analysis
❌ No fund / stock recommendations
❌ No budgeting suggestions
❌ No RBI / NPCI integration
❌ No PAN, bank login, or scraping

🔹 Success Criteria

App passes Google Play SMS permission review

App is SEBI-safe by design

App works offline for SMS explanations

Gmail integration is optional

MVP can be built by a solo developer using Replit AI
